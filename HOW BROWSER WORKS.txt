How BROWSER works?

  1) when we search any wesite for the first time in search box it goes for the DNS(Domain Name Server) to get IP adress of that     particular's website.

  2) Along with the ip address request goes to the server to make TCP connection,before making a connection there are two handshake process     should be done(ack-syn-ack-ack and another one three way handshake process to check safety).

  3) After these handshake process done the TCP connection should be established the data shoud be transfer to the user as per the request.

  4) Once the data recieved the browser the parser parses the HTML and CSS into DOMTREE and CSSSOM.

  5) The tree structure is then renderer by using rendering engine and then painted,printed on the screen.
